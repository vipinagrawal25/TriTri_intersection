The code computes intersection of two triangles embeded in 3 dimensional space. It is an update of the original code at [JGT-code,Volume_08,Number_1](https://github.com/erich666/jgt-code/tree/master/Volume_08/Number_1/Guigue2003).

### Changes:
	* Our code return 0 if the triangles are sharing an edge.
	* Our code do not compute the line of intersection, which makes it faster (5%) than the existing code. It also implies that this is the fastest code for computing the triangle-triangle intersection for double precision.
	* Our code fixes a small bug in the existing code. While comparing two double value, we add a small tolerance (1e=14) to take care of the small floating point errors that the code builds.

### About:
	* data repository contains two files: "intersected.txt" and "separated.txt". ``intersected.txt''

Abstract:

This paper presents an algorithm for determining whether two triangles in three dimensions intersect. The general scheme is identical to the one proposed by MÃ¶ller. The main difference is that our algorithm relies exclusively on the sign of 4 x 4 determinants and does not need any intermediate explicit constructions which are source of numerical errors. Besides the fact that the resulting code is more reliable than existing methods, it is also more efficient. The source code is available online.
